- In Rust, you can declare a new variable with the same name as an earlier one, effectively _shadowing_ the original so that only the most recent declaration is visible to the compiler until either it itself is shadowed or the scope ends.

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;

    let x = x + 1;

    {
        let x = x * 2;
        println!("The value of x in the inner scope is: {x}"); // 12
    }

    println!("The value of x is: {x}"); // 6
}
```

- Shadowing is different from marking a variable as `mut` because weâ€™ll get a compile-time error if we accidentally try to reassign to this variable without using the `let` keyword. By using `let`, we can perform a few transformations on a value but have the variable be immutable after those transformations have been completed.
