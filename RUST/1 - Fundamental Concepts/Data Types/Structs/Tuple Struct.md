- Rust also supports structs that look similar to tuples, called _tuple structs_.
	- Tuple structs are useful when you want to give the whole tuple a name and make the tuple a different type from other tuples, and when naming each field as in a regular struct would be verbose or redundant.
- Tuple structs have the added meaning the struct name provides but donâ€™t have names associated with their fields; rather, they just have the types of the fields.

```rust
struct Color(i32, i32, i32);
struct Point(i32, i32, i32);

fn main() {
    let black = Color(0, 0, 0);
    let origin = Point(0, 0, 0);
}
```

- Tuple struct instances are similar to tuples in that you can destructure them into their individual pieces, and you can use a `.` followed by the index to access an individual value. Unlike tuples, tuple structs require you to name the type of the struct when you destructure them.  
```rust
let Point(x, y, z) = point;
```
