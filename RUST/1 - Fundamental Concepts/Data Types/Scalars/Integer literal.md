- You can write integer literals in any of the forms shown in the table below. Note that number literals that can be multiple numeric types allow a type suffix, such as `57u8`, to designate the type. Number literals can also use `_` as a visual separator to make the number easier to read, such as `1_000`, which will have the same value as if you had specified `1000`.

|Number literals|Example|
|---|---|
|Decimal|`98_222`|
|Hex|`0xff`|
|Octal|`0o77`|
|Binary|`0b1111_0000`|
|Byte (`u8` only)|`b'A'`|
