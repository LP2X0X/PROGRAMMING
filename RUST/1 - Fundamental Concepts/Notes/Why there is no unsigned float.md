### ✅ 1. **The Sign Bit is Built-In**

All floating-point numbers (e.g., `f32`, `f64`) follow the **IEEE 754 standard**, which includes a **sign bit** by default:

- 1 bit = sign (positive or negative)
    
- Rest = exponent and fraction
    

So even if you **never want a negative number**, the format **reserves space** for one. You can’t opt out of it.

### ✅ 2. **Unsigned floats wouldn't gain you anything**

Unlike integers, where dropping the sign bit gives you a wider range (e.g., `u8` is 0–255 vs `i8` is −128–127), in floats:

- Removing the sign bit **only gives you ~1 extra bit of precision**, and **you lose the ability to represent negative values**.
    
- The precision gain **isn’t worth the complexity** or compatibility loss.

### ✅ 3. **CPU instructions and hardware support signed floats**

CPUs and GPUs are optimized for **signed floating-point operations** (via IEEE 754).

- There are **no native instructions for “unsigned floats.”**
    
- Supporting them would require **extra hardware or software handling**, which would slow things down.

### ✅ 4. **You can enforce non-negative floats logically**

In practice, if you need an “unsigned float,” you just:

- Use a regular `f32` or `f64`
    
- Ensure your logic never produces a negative number
    

```rust
let size: f32 = 5.0; // "unsigned float" in logic
```

Or clamp it:

```rust
let positive = value.max(0.0);
```

### 🧠 Summary:

|Reason|Explanation|
|---|---|
|IEEE 754 standard|All floats include a sign bit by design|
|No CPU support|Hardware expects signed floats only|
|Minimal gain|Unsigned float adds almost no value|
|Easy workaround|You can just prevent negatives in logic|
