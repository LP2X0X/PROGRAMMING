- The _crate root_ is a source file that the Rust compiler starts from and makes up the root module of your crate.

```ad-note
_src/main.rs_ and _src/lib.rs_ are called crate roots. The reason for their name is that the contents of either of these two files form a module named `crate` at the root of the crateâ€™s module structure, known as the [[Module Tree|module tree]].
