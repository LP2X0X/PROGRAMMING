**LINQPad** is one of the **best tools** for practicing and learning **LINQ**, **C#**, and **SQL** (especially LINQ to SQL and Entity Framework). Many developers (including interviewers!) use it daily to test queries and snippets.

---

## 🔍 What Is LINQPad?

**LINQPad** is a lightweight, powerful **code scratchpad** for .NET.  
You can run:

- LINQ queries
    
- C#/VB/F# code
    
- SQL (against local or remote databases)
    
- Entity Framework Core and LINQ-to-SQL queries
    

You don't need a full Visual Studio project — just **type and run**.

## ✅ Why Use LINQPad to Practice SQL?

### 🔸 1. **Connect to Real Databases**

You can connect to:

- SQL Server
    
- SQLite
    
- MySQL (Pro version)
    
- PostgreSQL
    
- Oracle (Pro)
    

And write **raw SQL**, or query using **LINQ to Entities**.

### 🔸 2. **Practice LINQ & SQL Side by Side**

You can write:

```csharp
from c in Customers
where c.City == "Berlin"
select c
```

Or directly:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE City = 'Berlin'
```

Perfect for learning both LINQ and SQL.

### 🔸 3. **Explore Data Instantly**

- Built-in **schema explorer** for DBs
    
- Results shown in grid like SSMS
    
- You can inspect objects, use charts, or dump data with `.Dump()`

## 🧠 Tip for Interview Prep

Use LINQPad to:

- Load a sample DB (e.g., Northwind)
    
- Practice converting **SQL questions into LINQ**
    
- Write both `query syntax` and `method syntax`
