# Programming Knowledge Vault (Obsidian)

This repository contains a personal Obsidian vault curated and systematically organized to capture programming knowledge over time.

## Purpose
The goal of this vault is to serve as a long-term knowledge base for software development concepts, patterns, and practical insights gathered through study and real-world experience. Notes are refined over time rather than collected as raw or temporary references.

## Content
The vault covers a broad range of programming topics, including but not limited to:
- Programming languages
- Software design principles and patterns
- Frontend development
- Tooling, workflows, and best practices
- Conceptual explanations and distilled learnings

## Organization
- Notes are written as small, focused units.
- Related concepts are connected via links and backlinks.
- Folders provide high-level grouping, while links provide real structure.
- Some notes act as indexes or maps of content (MOCs).
