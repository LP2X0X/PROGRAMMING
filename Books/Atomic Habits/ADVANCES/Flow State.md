**Flow state**—sometimes called “being in the zone”—is a mental state where you’re fully immersed in an activity, feeling energized, focused, and enjoying the process. Time flies, distractions disappear, and you’re just _in it_.

### **Characteristics of Flow:**
- **Deep focus** on the task
- **Loss of self-consciousness**
- **Distorted sense of time** (it feels like 5 minutes, but it’s been an hour)
- **Sense of control** over your actions
- **Intrinsic motivation** (you’re doing it for the joy of doing it)
- **Clear goals** and **immediate feedback**
- The task is **challenging but doable** (hello, Goldilocks Rule!)

### **Common Flow Activities:**
- Playing music or sports
- Writing, coding, painting
- Solving complex problems
- Gaming

### **How to Get Into Flow:**
1. **Eliminate distractions** (turn off notifications, create a quiet space)
2. **Set clear, achievable goals**
3. **Work on tasks that stretch your skills** without overwhelming you
4. **Do something meaningful or engaging to you**
5. **Focus for an extended period** (flow often kicks in after 10–15 minutes of undistracted work)
