The **Goldilocks Rule** refers to the idea that humans experience peak motivation and performance when working on tasks that are _just the right level of difficulty_—not too hard, not too easy, but just challenging enough to keep us engaged and progressing. The term comes from the fairy tale _Goldilocks and the Three Bears_, where Goldilocks chooses things that are “just right.”

### **In Practice:**
- **Too Easy:** You get bored.
- **Too Hard:** You get anxious or frustrated.
- **Just Right:** You enter a flow state—focused, productive, and motivated.

### **Example:**
If you’re learning to play guitar:
- Playing songs you’ve already mastered gets boring.
- Trying to shred like a pro right away is overwhelming.
- Learning a slightly more complex chord progression than you’re used to keeps you engaged and improving.

### **In Productivity & Learning:**
The Goldilocks Rule is often cited in books like _Atomic Habits_ by James Clear. It’s useful for:
- Building habits
- Setting goals
- Structuring learning routines
