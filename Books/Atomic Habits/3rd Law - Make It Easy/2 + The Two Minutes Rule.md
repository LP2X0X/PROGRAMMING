- When you dream about making a change, excitement inevitably takes over and you end up trying to do too much too soon. The most effective way I know to counteract this tendency is to use the Two-Minute Rule , which states, “When you start a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do.”
- The idea is to make your habits as easy as possible to start.
- People often think it’s weird to get hyped about reading one page or meditating for one minute or making one sales call. But the point is not to do one thing. The point is to master the habit of showing up. The truth is, a habit must be established before it can be improved.
```ad-note
Standardize before you optimize. You can’t improve a habit that doesn’t exist.
