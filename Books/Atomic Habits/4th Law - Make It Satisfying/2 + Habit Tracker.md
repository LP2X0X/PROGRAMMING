- Making progress is satisfying, and visual measures—like moving paper clips or hairpins or marbles—provide clear evidence of your progress.
- The best way to measure your progress is with a habit tracker.
- The habit stacking + habit tracking formula is:
  
```ad-note
After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [TRACK MY HABIT].
```
