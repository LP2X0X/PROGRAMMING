### 1 - Imitating the Close
- We pick up habits from the people around us.
- Therefore, you should surround yourself with people who have the habits you want to have yourself. You’ll rise together.
- Join a culture where (1) your desired behavior is the normal behavior and (2) you already have something in common with the group.

### 2 - Imitating the Many
- Whenever we are unsure how to act, we look to the group to guide our behavior.
- There is tremendous internal pressure to comply with the norms of the group. The reward of being accepted is often greater than the reward of winning an argument, looking smart, or finding truth. Most days, we’d rather be wrong with the crowd than be right by ourselves.
- When changing your habits means challenging the tribe, change is unattractive. When changing your habits means fitting in with the tribe, change is very attractive.

### 3 - Imitating the Powerful
- Once we fit in, we start looking for ways to stand out.
- This is one reason we care so much about the habits of highly effective people. We try to copy the behavior of successful people because we desire success ourselves. We imitate people we envy.
