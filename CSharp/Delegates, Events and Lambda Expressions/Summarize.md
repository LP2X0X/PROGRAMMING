## 🔗 Summary of How Events, Delegates, and Handlers Work in C#

### ✅ 1. **Delegate** defines the **method signature**.
- Delegates are type-safe function pointers.
- They define what kind of method (return type + parameters) can be assigned or subscribed to events.

```csharp
public delegate void MyDelegate(string message);
```

> 🔸 This means: "Any method that returns `void` and accepts a single `string` can be used with this delegate."

---

### ✅ 2. **Event** is based on a delegate.
- An event is a **publisher** that notifies **subscribers** when something happens.
- Under the hood, it's just a delegate with some restrictions.

```csharp
public event MyDelegate MyEvent;
```

> 🔸 This event will allow methods matching `MyDelegate` to be subscribed using `+=`.

---

### ✅ 3. **Callback functions (event handlers)** must **match the delegate signature**.
- Subscribed methods (also called **event handlers**) **must match the delegate signature** – either via a named method, anonymous function, or lambda.

```csharp
// Matches: void (string)
void HandleEvent(string msg)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Received: " + msg);
}

// Subscribe
MyEvent += HandleEvent;
```

You can also do:

```csharp
MyEvent += (string msg) => Console.WriteLine("Lambda: " + msg);
```

---

### ✅ 4. **Invoke fires the event** — triggering all subscribers (callbacks).
- When the event is **invoked** inside some method or action, it **notifies all subscribers** by calling them (in the order they were added).

```csharp
MyEvent?.Invoke("Hello Events!");
```

> 🔸 If no handlers are subscribed, `MyEvent` will be null, so we use `?.Invoke(...)` to avoid exceptions.

---

## 🧠 Final Conceptual View

You can visualize it like this:

```
Delegate ← defines signature for callbacks
   ↓
Event ← a wrapper around a delegate to manage subscriptions
   ↓                          ↙
Subscribe (+=)         Callback methods (must match delegate)
   ↓
Invoke event → 🚨 All subscribed methods are called
```

---

## 🔁 Your Sentence, Refined:

> ✔️ _"An event uses `Invoke()` to notify all its subscribed event handlers (callback functions). These handlers must match the method signature defined by a delegate, ensuring type safety and consistency."_
