- A **friend function** is a function (member or non-member) that can access the private and protected members of a class as though it were a member of that class. In all other regards, the friend function is a normal function.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Accumulator
{
private:
    int m_value { 0 };

public:
    void add(int value) { m_value += value; }

    // Here is the friend declaration that makes non-member function void print(const Accumulator& accumulator) a friend of Accumulator
    friend void print(const Accumulator& accumulator);
};

void print(const Accumulator& accumulator)
{
    // Because print() is a friend of Accumulator
    // it can access the private members of Accumulator
    std::cout << accumulator.m_value;
}

int main()
{
    Accumulator acc{};
    acc.add(5); // add 5 to the accumulator

    print(acc); // call the print() non-member function

    return 0;
}
```

- In this example, we’ve declared a non-member function named `print()` that takes an object of class `Accumulator`. Because `print()` is not a member of the Accumulator class, it would normally not be able to access private member `m_value`. However, the Accumulator class has a friend declaration making `print(const Accumulator& accumulator)` a friend, this is now allowed.
- Note that because `print()` is a non-member function (and thus does not have an implicit object), we must explicitly pass an `Accumulator` object to `print()` to work with.

---

- Much like member functions can be defined inside a class if desired, friend non-member functions can also be defined inside a class.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Accumulator
{
private:
    int m_value { 0 };

public:
    void add(int value) { m_value += value; }

    // Friend functions defined inside a class are non-member functions
    friend void print(const Accumulator& accumulator)
    {
        // Because print() is a friend of Accumulator
        // it can access the private members of Accumulator
        std::cout << accumulator.m_value;
    }
};

int main()
{
    Accumulator acc{};
    acc.add(5); // add 5 to the accumulator

    print(acc); // call the print() non-member function

    return 0;
}
```

### Multiple friends
- A function can be a friend of more than one class at the same time:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Humidity; // forward declaration of Humidity

class Temperature
{
private:
    int m_temp { 0 };
public:
    explicit Temperature(int temp) : m_temp { temp } { }

    friend void printWeather(const Temperature& temperature, const Humidity& humidity); // forward declaration needed for this line
};

class Humidity
{
private:
    int m_humidity { 0 };
public:
    explicit Humidity(int humidity) : m_humidity { humidity } {  }

    friend void printWeather(const Temperature& temperature, const Humidity& humidity);
};

void printWeather(const Temperature& temperature, const Humidity& humidity)
{
    std::cout << "The temperature is " << temperature.m_temp <<
       " and the humidity is " << humidity.m_humidity << '\n';
}

int main()
{
    Humidity hum { 10 };
    Temperature temp { 12 };

    printWeather(temp, hum);

    return 0;
}
```
