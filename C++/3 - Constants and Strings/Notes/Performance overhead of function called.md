- Consider the following example:
	```cpp
	#include <iostream>
	
	int min(int x, int y)
	{
	    return (x < y) ? x : y;
	}
	
	int main()
	{
	    std::cout << min(5, 6) << '\n';
	    std::cout << min(3, 2) << '\n';
	    return 0;
	}
	```

- When a call to `min()` is encountered, the CPU must store the address of the current instruction it is executing (so it knows where to return to later) along with the values of various CPU registers (so they can be restored upon returning). Then parameters `x` and `y` must be instantiated and then initialized. Then the execution path has to jump to the code in the `min()` function. When the function ends, the program has to jump back to the location of the function call, and the return value has to be copied so it can be output. This has to be done for each function call. The extra work that must happen to set up and facilitate a function call is often called **overhead**.
- For functions that are large and/or perform complex tasks, the overhead of the function call is typically insignificant compared to the amount of time the function takes to run. However, for small functions (such as `min()` above), the overhead costs can be larger than the time needed to actually execute the functionâ€™s code! In cases where a small function is called often, using a function can result in a significant performance penalty over writing the same code in-place.
