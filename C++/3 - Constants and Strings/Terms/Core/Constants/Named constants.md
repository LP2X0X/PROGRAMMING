- **Named constants** are constant values that are associated with an identifier. These are also sometimes called **symbolic constants**, or occasionally just **constants**.

	- [[Constant variable|Constant variables]].
	- Object-like [[Macro|macros]] with substitution text.
	- Enumerated constants.
