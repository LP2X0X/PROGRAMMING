- If your conditional is an expression that does not evaluate to a Boolean value, the result of the [[Condition|conditional expression]] is converted to a Boolean value: non-zero values get converted to Boolean `true`, and zero-values get converted to Boolean `false`.
```ad-note
`if (x)` conditional expression means “if x is non-zero/non-empty”.
```
