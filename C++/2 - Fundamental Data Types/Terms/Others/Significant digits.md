- The digits in the significand (the part before the ‘e’) are called the **significant digits** (or **significant figures**). The more significant digits, the more precise a number is.

```ad-note
We assume trailing zeros in a whole number with no decimal are not significant.
```

```ad-important
When converting to scientific notation, trailing zeros after a decimal point are considered significant.
