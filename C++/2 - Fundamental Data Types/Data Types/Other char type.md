- Much like ASCII maps the integers 0-127 to American English characters, other character encoding standards exist to map integers (of varying sizes) to characters in other languages. The most well-known mapping outside of ASCII is the Unicode standard, which maps over 144,000 integers to characters in many different languages. Because Unicode contains so many code points, a single Unicode code point needs 32-bits to represent a character (called UTF-32). However, Unicode characters can also be encoded using multiple 16-bit or 8-bit characters (called UTF-16 and UTF-8 respectively).

- `char16_t` and `char32_t` were added to C++11 to provide explicit support for 16-bit and 32-bit Unicode characters. These char types have the same size as `std::uint_least16_t` and `std::uint_least32_t` respectively (but are distinct types). `char8_t` was added in C++20 to provide support for 8-bit Unicode (UTF-8). It is a distinct type that uses the same representation as `unsigned char`.

- You won’t need to use `char8_t`, `char16_t`, or `char32_t` unless you’re planning on making your program Unicode compatible. `wchar_t` should be avoided in almost all cases (except when interfacing with the Windows API), as its size is implementation-defined.
