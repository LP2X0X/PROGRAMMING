- A **declaration** tells the _compiler_ about the _existence_ of an identifier and its associated type information.
- A **definition** is a declaration that actually implements (for functions and types) or instantiates (for variables) the identifier.

```ad-summary
**Declare** - to announce officially; proclaim.
**Define** - to show or describe (someone or something) clearly and completely.
