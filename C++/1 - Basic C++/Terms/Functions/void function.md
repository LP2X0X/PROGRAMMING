- Functions are not required to return a value back to the caller. To tell the compiler that a function does not return a value, a return type of **void** is used. A function that does not return a value is called a **non-value returning function** (or a **void function**).

```ad-tip
Do not put a return statement at the end of a non-value returning function.
