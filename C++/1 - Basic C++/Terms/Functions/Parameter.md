- A [[C++/1 - Basic C++/Terms/Core/Function||function]]'s **parameter** is a variable used in the header of a function. It works almost identically to variable defined inside the function but with one difference: they are initialized with a value provided by the caller of the function.
- **Unreferenced parameter** is parameter that are not used in the body of a function.

- In a function definition, the name of a function parameter is optional. Therefore, in cases where a function parameter needs to exist but is not used in the body of the function, you can simply omit the name. A parameter without a name is called an **[[Unnamed parameter|unnamed parameter]]**.
