- The :: symbol is an operator called the **scope resolution operator**. 
- The identifier to the left of the `::` symbol identifies the namespace that the name to the right of the `::` symbol is contained within. 
- If no identifier to the left of the `::` symbol is provided, the global namespace is assumed.
