- In programming, the name of the function (or object, type, template,...) is called its **identifier**.

---

### Naming best practices
- It is conventional in C++ that variable names should begin with a lowercase letter.
- Most often, function names are also started with a lowercase letter.
- Identifier names that start with a capital letter are typically used for **user-defined types** (such as structs, classes, and enumerations).

```ad-tip
A good rule of thumb is to make the length of an identifier proportional to how specific and accessible the identifier is.
