- When a [[C++/1 - Basic C++/Terms/Functions/Function|function]] is called, all of the parameters of the function are created as variables, and the value of each of the arguments is _copied_ into the matching parameter (using [[Copy-initialization|copy initialization]]). This process is called **pass by value**.
