- An **Expression statement** is a statement that consists of ***only*** an expression followed by a semicolon. When the expression statement is executed, the expression will be evaluated.

```ad-note
When an expression is used in an expression statement, any return value generated by the expression is discarded if it's not assign any where else (because it is not used).
```
