- The main memory in a computer is called **Random Access Memory** or RAM for short.
```ad-note
When we run a program the operating system loads the program into RAM.
```
- The operating system also reserves some additional RAM for the program to use while it is running. Common uses for this memory are to store values entered by the user, to store data read in from a file or network, or to store values calculated while the program is running (e.g. the sum of two values) so they can be used again later.
