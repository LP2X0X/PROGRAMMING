- Programmers tend to make certain kinds of common mistakes, and some of those mistakes can be discovered by programs trained to look for them. These programs, generally known as **static analysis tools** (sometimes informally called _linters_) are programs that analyze your code to identify specific semantic issues (in this context, _static_ means that these tools analyze the source code). The issues found by static analysis tools may or may not be the cause of any particular problem you are having, but may help point out fragile areas of code or issues that can be problematic in certain circumstances.
