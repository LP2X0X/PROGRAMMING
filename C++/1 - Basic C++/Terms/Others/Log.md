- A **log** is a sequential record of events that have happened, usually time-stamped. The process of generating a log is called **logging**. Typically, logs are written to a file on disk (called a **log file**) so they can be reviewed later. Most applications and operating systems write log files that can be used to help diagnose issues that occur.
