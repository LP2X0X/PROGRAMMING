- If two operators with the same precedence level are adjacent to each other in an expression, the operatorâ€™s **associativity** tells the compiler whether to evaluate the operators from left to right or from right to left. Subtraction has precedence level 6, and the operators in precedence level 6 have an associativity of left to right. So this expression is grouped from left to right: `(7 - 4) - 1`.
