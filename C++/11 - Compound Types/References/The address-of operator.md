- Although the memory addresses used by variables aren’t exposed to us by default, we do have access to this information. The **address-of operator** (&) returns the memory address of its operand. This is pretty straightforward:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    int x{ 5 };
    std::cout << x << '\n';  // print the value of variable x
    std::cout << &x << '\n'; // print the memory address of variable x

    return 0;
}
```
