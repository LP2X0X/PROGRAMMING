- In JavaScript, functions can have properties in addition to being callable. However, the function type expression syntax doesn’t allow for declaring properties. If we want to describe something callable with properties, we can write a _call signature_ in an object type:

```ts
type DescribableFunction = {
  description: string;
  (someArg: number): boolean;
};
function doSomething(fn: DescribableFunction) {
  console.log(fn.description + " returned " + fn(6));
}

function myFunc(someArg: number) {
  return someArg > 3;
}
myFunc.description = "default description";

doSomething(myFunc);
```

```ad-note
Note that the syntax is slightly different compared to a function type expression - use `:` between the parameter list and the return type rather than `=>`.
