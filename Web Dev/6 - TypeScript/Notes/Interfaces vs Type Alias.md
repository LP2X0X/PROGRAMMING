Type aliases and interfaces are very similar, and in many cases you can choose between them freely. Almost all features of an `interface` are available in `type`, the key distinction is that a type cannot be re-opened to add new properties vs an interface which is always extendable.

```ad-note
Type can also represent everything where interface can only represent object type.
