- In `transition-property`, we write a list of properties to animate, for instance: `left`, `margin-left`, `height`, `color`. Or we could write `all`, which means “animate all properties”.

- Do note that, there are properties which can not be animated. However, [most of the generally used properties are animatable](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_animated_properties).
