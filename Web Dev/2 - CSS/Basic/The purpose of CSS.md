- The **purpose of CSS** is to "select" an HTML element and apply some type of style to that HTML element. Here are the two things that CSS can do for you:
	1. Change the **layout** of HTML elements on the page (rows, columns, sections, sizes)
	2. Change the **style** of HTML elements on the page (fonts, colors)
