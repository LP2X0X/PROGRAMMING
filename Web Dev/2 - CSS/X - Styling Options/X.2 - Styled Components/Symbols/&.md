### 🔹 What `&` represents

- `&` refers to **the current styled component’s selector**
    
- It is replaced with the **generated class name** at runtime
    

---

### 🔹 Why it is needed

- Styled-components do **not use global class names**
    
- The component’s selector is **implicit**
    
- `&` allows you to explicitly target the component itself

### 🔹 Common use cases

- Pseudo-classes
    
    ```css
    &:hover { }
    &:focus { }
    ```
    
- Pseudo-elements
    
    ```css
    &::after { }
    ```
    
- Modifier states
    
    ```css
    &.active { }
    ```
    
- Nested selectors
    
    ```css
    & > span { }
    ```

### 🔹 What happens under the hood

- `&` is replaced with a unique, generated class
    
- Ensures **style encapsulation**
    
- Prevents global selector conflicts
    

---

### 📌 Key takeaway

> `&` is a scoped reference to the styled component itself, enabling pseudo-classes, nesting, and state-based styling within CSS-in-JS.
