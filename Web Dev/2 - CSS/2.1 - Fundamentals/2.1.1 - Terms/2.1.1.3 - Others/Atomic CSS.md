- **Idea**: Every class does **one tiny job** (e.g., `mt-4`, `text-center`, `flex`).
    
- **Goal**: Build UI by **composing small utility classes** instead of writing custom CSS.
    
- **Benefits**: Fast development, consistent spacing, fewer custom styles, no naming worries.
    
- **Examples**: Tailwind, Tachyons, UnoCSS.
    
- **Key trait**: Classes map directly to **single-purpose CSS rules**, not components or semantics.
