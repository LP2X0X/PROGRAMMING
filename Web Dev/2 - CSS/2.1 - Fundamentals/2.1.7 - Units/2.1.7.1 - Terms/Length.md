- **Length** is the formal name for a CSS value that denotes a distance measurement. It’s a number followed by a unit, such as 5px. Percentages are similar to lengths, but strictly speaking, they’re not considered lengths.

```ad-note
A peculiar quirk of inheritance: when an element has a value defined using a length (px, em, rem, and so forth), its computed value is inherited by child elements.
