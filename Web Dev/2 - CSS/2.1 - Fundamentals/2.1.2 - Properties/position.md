In CSS, the position property defines how an element is positioned in the document. There are **five main values**:

---

### **üîß position Values**

|**Value**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|static|Default. Element is in the normal document flow.|
|relative|Offsets the element relative to its **normal position**.|
|absolute|Removes the element from flow, no space is created for the element in the page layout and positions it **relative to the nearest positioned ancestor** (not static).|
|fixed|Positions element relative to the **viewport**; stays fixed during scroll.|
|sticky|Scrolls normally until it reaches a threshold, then sticks in place.|

```ad-note
The element is positioned relative to its closest positioned ancestor (if any) or to the initial [[The Containing Block|containing block]].
```

### ‚ùìHow it affect the flow?

Normally, elements are laid out one after another, block by block or inline by inline. This is called the **[[Normal Flow]].

When an element is **taken out of flow**, it no longer affects the positioning of other elements around it (siblings behave as if it isn‚Äôt there).


#### **üñãÔ∏è Position Values & Flow Behavior**

- **static** (default)
    - ‚úÖ Stays in normal flow.
    - No special positioning applied.
- **relative**
    - ‚úÖ Stays in normal flow (still occupies its original space).
    - ‚ùó Moves visually relative to its original position, but surrounding elements act as if it didn‚Äôt move.
- **absolute**
    - ‚ùå Taken out of flow.
    - Positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (relative, absolute, fixed, or sticky).
    - Does not affect sibling layout ‚Äî they behave as if it‚Äôs not there.
- **fixed**
    - ‚ùå Taken out of flow.
    - Positioned relative to the **viewport** (browser window).
    - Stays in place even when scrolling.
- **sticky**
    - ‚úÖ Initially in normal flow.
    - ‚ùó Switches to fixed-like behavior when a scroll threshold is reached.
    - Still occupies space in the flow (siblings are aware of it).

#### **üí° Example**

```
.box1 {
  position: relative; /* stays in flow */
  top: 20px;
}
.box2 {
  position: absolute; /* out of flow */
  top: 0;
  right: 0;
}
```

Here, .box1 still affects others‚Äô positions, but .box2 doesn‚Äôt ‚Äî it‚Äôs removed from the flow.

#### **üõ†Ô∏è Tips & Best Practices**

- Use **relative** when you want small offsets but still want the element to ‚Äúreserve space.‚Äù
- Use **absolute/fixed** sparingly for floating UI (tooltips, modals, etc.), not for main layouts.
- Remember that removing an element from flow may cause overlaps, so you‚Äôll often need z-index.

### **üß† Example:**

```html
<div class="box">I'm positioned</div>
```

```css
.box {
  position: absolute;
  top: 50px;
  left: 100px;
}
```

This positions .box **50px from the top** and **100px from the left** of the **nearest non-static parent**.

### **üß≤ Quick Tips:**

- Always pair absolute, relative, fixed, or sticky with top, left, right, or bottom.
    
- Absolute looks for the nearest ancestor with position: relative, absolute, or fixed.
    
- Sticky works only if its parent has a defined height and overflow allows scrolling.
