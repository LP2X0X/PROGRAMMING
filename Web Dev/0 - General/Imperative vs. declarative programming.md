### 🧑‍💻 **Imperative vs. Declarative Programming**

Both **imperative** and **declarative** programming are two core paradigms in software development, but they approach problem-solving in fundamentally different ways. Here’s a breakdown of their differences:

---

### 📌 **1. Definition**

|Paradigm|Definition|
|---|---|
|**Imperative**|Describes **how** to do something, step by step.|
|**Declarative**|Describes **what** you want to achieve, not how.|

---

### 🧱 **2. Key Differences**

|Feature|**Imperative**|**Declarative**|
|---|---|---|
|**Focus**|**Process (How)** – step-by-step instructions|**Outcome (What)** – describe the goal|
|**Control**|Explicit control over program flow|Abstracts away program flow|
|**State Management**|Requires manual state handling|State is often managed automatically|
|**Complexity**|Can be more complex for larger systems|Often simpler and easier to read|
|**Examples**|Loops, conditionals, mutable state|Functional transformations, queries|
|**Languages**|C, C++, Java (procedural/OOP)|SQL, HTML, React (JSX), Haskell|

### 📊 **3. Examples**

✅ **Imperative Approach (C++ Loop Example)**  
This explicitly controls how to sum a list of numbers:

```cpp
int sum = 0;
std::vector<int> numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
for (int i = 0; i < numbers.size(); i++) {
    sum += numbers[i];
}
std::cout << "Sum: " << sum << std::endl;
```

✅ **Declarative Approach (C++ with `std::accumulate`)**  
This describes **what** to do, not **how**:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <numeric>

int main() {
    std::vector<int> numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    int sum = std::accumulate(numbers.begin(), numbers.end(), 0);
    std::cout << "Sum: " << sum << std::endl;
}
```

### 🔍 **4. When to Use Which?**

|**Use Imperative**|**Use Declarative**|
|---|---|
|When you need **fine-grained control**|For **simpler and more readable** code|
|In **performance-critical** applications|When working with **data transformations**|
|**Low-level operations** (e.g., memory)|When using **frameworks/libraries** (e.g., React)|

---

### 📚 **5. Hybrid Approach**

Modern programming often **mixes** both paradigms:

- **React (Declarative UI)** + **JavaScript (Imperative Logic)**
- **SQL Queries (Declarative)** inside **Python (Imperative)**
