- A valid identifier is any series of characters that can be used as a JavaScript variable name.
- An identifier can consist of letters, numbers, and the characters _ and $, but it can’t start with a number.
- It also can’t contain other symbols, like \*, (, or #, nor can it include whitespace characters like spaces and newlines. These other characters are allowed in object keys, but only if the key is enclosed in quotes.
