- A **higher-order function** is a function that takes another function as an argument, or that outputs another function as its return value.
- To create your own higher-order function that takes a callback as an argument, simply include a name for the callback in the function’s list of parameters, just as you’d name any other parameter. Then, when you want to call the callback within the function body, add parentheses after the parameter name, just like calling any other function.
