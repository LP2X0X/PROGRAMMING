- **SVG** (or Scalable Vector Graphic) is a way of defining images using points, lines, and curves, rather than pixels. These images are known as vector graphics.
- Because youâ€™re defining the shape of the image rather than the individual pixels themselves, you can resize or zoom in on an SVG image without it becoming pixelated (hence the scalable part of the name).
