tags:
  - html
  - distinguish
  - fundamental

- different between a "[[Tag|tag]]" and an "[[Element|element]]": The terms are often used interchangeably, but I generally view an "element" as a complete unit while I think of a "tag" as a symbol.

Here's an element:

```html
<p class="paragraph-style">Some content</p>
```

And here's a tag:

```html
<p></p>
```
