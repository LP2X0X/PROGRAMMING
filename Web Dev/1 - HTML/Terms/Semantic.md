- The [semantics](https://web.dev/learn/html/semantic-html?authuser=1), or `role`, of an element is important to assistive technologies and, in some cases, search engines. HTML should be used to structure content, not to define the content's appearance. Appearance is the realm of CSS. While many elements that alter the appearance of content, such as `<h1>`, `<strong>`, and `<em>`, have a semantic meaning, the appearance can and generally will be changed with author styles.
