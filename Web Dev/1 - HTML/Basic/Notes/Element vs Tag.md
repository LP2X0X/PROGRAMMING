tags: html, distinguish, fundamental
---

- different between a "[[Tags|tag]]" and an "[[Web Dev/1 - HTML/Basic/Terms/Elements|element]]": The terms are often used interchangeably, but I generally view an "element" as a complete unit while I think of a "tag" as a symbol.

Here's an element:

```html
<p class="paragraph-style">Some content</p>
```

And here's a tag:

```html
<p></p>
```
