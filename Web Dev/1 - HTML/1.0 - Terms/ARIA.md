- Accessible Rich Internet Applications **(ARIA)** is a set of [roles](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles) and [attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes) that define ways to make web content and web applications (especially those developed with JavaScript) more accessible to people with disabilities.

- ARIA supplements HTML so that interactions and widgets commonly used in applications can be passed to assistive technologies when there is not otherwise a mechanism. For example, ARIA enables accessible JavaScript widgets, form hints and error messages, live content updates, and more.
