A **void element** is an HTML element that:

- **Has no closing tag**, and
    
- **Cannot contain any content inside**, not even text or other elements.
    

They are _self-contained_ because they represent something that doesn’t need inner content.

Examples include:

```html
<br>
<img>
<meta>
<link>
<input>
<hr>
```

These are always written without a closing tag:

```html
<br>
<img src="image.png">
<input type="text">
```
