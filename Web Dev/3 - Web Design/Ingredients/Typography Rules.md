| **Main Point** | **Details** |
|----------------|-------------|
| Use only good and popular typefaces | Play it safe by sticking to trusted fonts |
| One or two typefaces per page | It’s fine to use just **one typeface**. If more, limit to **2**. <br> - Too many typefaces look amateurish |
| Choose typeface by website personality | - Match the typeface to your website’s personality <br> - Decide between serif vs. sans-serif <br> - Experiment with popular Google Fonts and “good” typefaces <br> - Try different typefaces while designing to find the best fit |
| Limit font-size choices | Use a **type scale tool** or pre-defined ranges |
| Font size for normal text | Between **16px and 32px** |
| Font size for long text | Use **20px or larger** for readability (e.g. blog posts) |
| Font size for headlines | Go **50px+** and bold (**600+**) depending on personality |
| Minimum font weight | Don’t go below **400 (regular)** |
| Characters per line | Keep lines under **75 characters** |
| Line-height | - For normal text: **1.5 – 2** <br> - For large text: below **1.5** <br> - Smaller + longer text → needs larger line-height |
| Letter spacing in headlines | Reduce if it looks unnatural (comes with experience) |
| All caps for short titles | Works well if **small, bold, and with increased letter-spacing** |
| Don’t justify text | Usually avoid justification |
| Don’t center long text | Small blocks are fine, but not large paragraphs |
