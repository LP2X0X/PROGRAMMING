## 1 - Use only good and popular typefaces and play it safe

## 2 - It's ok to use just one typeface per page! If you want more, limit to 2 typefaces
- A page with a lot of typefaces will make it look amateurish.
  
## 3 - Choose the right typeface acording to your website personality
-  Choose the right personality for your website 
-  Decide between a serif and sans-serif typeface
-  Experiment with all the “good” typefaces (and other typefaces from Google Fonts!) to see which ones best fits your website’s message _(this will come with experience)_
-  You can keep trying different typefaces as you design and build the page

## 4 - When choosing font-sizes, limit choices! Use a "type scale" tool or other pre-defined range
## 5 - Use a font size between 16px and 32px for "normal text"
## 6 - For long text (like a blog post), try a size of 20px or even bigger
## 7 - For headline, you can go really big (50px+) and bold (600+), depending on personality
## 8 - For any text, don't use a font weight under 400 (regular)
## 9 - Use less than 75 characters per line
## 10 - For normal-sized text, use a line height between 1.5 and 2. For big text, go below 1.5
- The smaller and longer the text, the larger the line height need to be
## 11 - Decrease letter spacing in headlines, if it looks unnatural (this will come from experience)
## 12 - Experiment with all caps for short titles. Make them small and bold and increase letter-spacing
## 13 - Usually, don't justify text
## 14 - Don't center long text blocks. Small blocks are fine.
