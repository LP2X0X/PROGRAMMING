| Use good color tone | Don’t choose a random tone or CSS named colors |
| Minimum palette | You need at least **two types of colors**: a main color and a gray color |
| Expand with experience | Add accent (secondary) colors using a color tool |
| Create diversity | Make lighter (tint) and darker (shade) versions of your main colors |
| Use main color strategically | Apply it to the most important elements (e.g. buttons, logos) |
| Use colors for accents | Make entire components or sections stand out |
| Use color in visuals | Apply your palette strategically in images and illustrations |
| Text on dark backgrounds | Use a **tint of the background** (lighter version) for readability |
| Text color balance | Avoid pure black; lighten text if it looks heavy and uninviting |
| Ensure text contrast | Don’t make text too light! Use contrast tools. <br> Contrast ratio: **4.5:1** for normal text, **3:1** for large text (18px+) |
