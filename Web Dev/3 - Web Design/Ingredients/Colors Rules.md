1. **Make the main color match your website's personality: colors convey meaning!**
   - **Red** draws a lot of attention, and symbolizes power, passion, and excitement
   - **Orange** is less aggressive, and conveys happiness, cheerfulness, and creativity
   - **Yellow** means joy, brightness, and intelligence
   - **Greens** represents harmony, nature, growth, and health
   - **Blue** is associated with peace, trustworthiness, and professionalism
   - **Purple** conveys wealth, wisdom, and magic
   - **Pink** represents romance, care, and affection
   - **Brown** is associated with nature, durability and comfort
   - **Black** symbolizes power, elegance and minimalism, but also grief and sorrow

2. **Use good color tone! Don't choose a random tone or CSS named colors**

3. **You need at least two types of colors in your palette: a main color and a gray color**

4. **With more experience, you can add more colors: accent (secondary) colors (use a tool)**

5. **For diversity, create lighter and darker "versions" (tint and shades)**

6. **Use your main color to draw attention to the most important elements on the page (buttons or logos)**

7. **Use colors to add interesting accents or make entire components or sections stand out**

8. **You can try to use your color strategically in images and illustrations**

9. **On dark colored backgrounds, try to use a tint of  the background ("lighter version") for text**

10. **Text should usually not be completely black. Lighten it up if it looks heavy and uninviting**

11. **Don't make text too light! Use a tool to check contrast between text and background colors**
	- The contrast ratio needs to be at least 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for larger text (18px+)
