## 💻 **Web Development**

🔹 **Focus:** _How the website works_ (functionality + logic).  
🔹 **Main concerns:**

- Making the design “come alive” in the browser
    
- Interactivity (forms, animations, dynamic updates)
    
- Backend logic (databases, servers, APIs)
    
- Performance, security, scalability
    

🔹 **Types:**

- **Backend Development:** (behind the scenes) → Node.js, C#, Python (Django/Flask), Java, PHP
    
- **Full-Stack Development:** both frontend + backend
    

🔹 **Skills:**

- Coding, debugging, problem solving
    
- Knowledge of frameworks and libraries

## ⚖️ **Comparison in one line:**

- **Web Design = appearance & experience** (the _what it looks like_).
    
- **Web Development = structure & functionality** (the _how it works_).

👉 Many companies expect **collaboration**:

- A **designer** makes the mockups/wireframes.
    
- A **developer** builds the actual website based on those designs.
    
- A **full-stack dev** may do both (especially in startups).
