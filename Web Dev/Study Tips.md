Since you’re trying to learn **React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, and DSA** at 30–35 hrs/week, the main challenge isn’t _finding_ time — it’s **organizing** it so your brain retains it all without burning out.

Here’s the **best tactic** I recommend (based on how pros learn multiple skills at once):

---

## 1️⃣ **Learn in Layers, Not in Silos**

Don’t do “3 weeks of HTML, then 3 weeks of JS” — you’ll forget things.  
Instead:

- Learn **just enough HTML/CSS** to make a small UI
    
- Then **add JavaScript** to make it interactive
    
- Then **add React** to manage UI state
    
- Then **add TypeScript** to improve safety
    
- Keep cycling through topics in small, repeated passes so each skill reinforces the others.
    

**Example**  
Week 1: HTML/CSS → Week 2: Add JS → Week 3: Add React → Week 4: Add TS → Week 5: Bigger React project.

## 2️⃣ **Daily Topic Rotation**

Instead of cramming one subject all day, rotate subjects to improve retention.

- Morning: Theory + small code drills (fresh brain → better for absorbing rules)
    
- Afternoon: Project building (ties theory into real use)
    
- Evening: DSA problem-solving (keeps your algorithmic thinking sharp without blocking creative work).

## 3️⃣ **Use Project-Driven Learning**

Don’t just “learn topics” — build something every week.

- **Tiny apps first**: Counter, to-do list, weather app
    
- **Add complexity over time**: Authentication, API integration, state management
    
- **Refactor old projects** with TypeScript when you learn it — this reinforces both old and new knowledge.

## 4️⃣ **Spaced Repetition for DSA**

For algorithms & data structures:

- Practice **3–4 problems/day** instead of a “DSA-only day”
    
- Use a pattern-based approach (sliding window, two pointers, recursion, BFS/DFS, DP)
    
- Revisit problems after 2–3 days → then after 1 week → then after 1 month

## 5️⃣ **Active Recall Instead of Passive Watching**

- Don’t just watch videos — stop and **code it from scratch**
    
- Explain the concept out loud as if teaching someone else
    
- Keep a **cheat sheet** for syntax, patterns, and gotchas
    

---

## 6️⃣ **Weekly Review & Fix Weak Spots**

At the end of each week:

- Review your code & notes
    
- Identify 1–2 weak areas → focus extra time next week
    
- Deploy at least one small project so you get used to Git + deployment (Netlify, Vercel)

## 7️⃣ **Balance Deep Focus and Rest**

- Work in **90-minute deep-focus sessions**
    
- Take **10–15 min breaks**
    
- One day per week for **light review** or rest — your brain cements knowledge during downtime
