- The **Document Object Model** (DOM) is an object representation of the HTML elements. It acts as a bridge between your code and the user interface, and has a tree-like structure with parent and child relationships.
- The HTML represents the **initial page content**, whereas the DOM represents the **updated page content** which was changed by the JavaScript code you wrote.
