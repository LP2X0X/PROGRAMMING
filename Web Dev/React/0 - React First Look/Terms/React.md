- React is a declarative, component-based, state-driven Javascript library for building user interface.
	- **Component-based**: Components are building blocks of user interfaces. We combine and reuse these components to create the user interface.
	- **Declarative**: We describe how components look like and how they work using a declarative syntax called [[Web Dev/React/0 - React First Look/Terms/JSX]].
	- **State-driven**: React reacts to state changes by re-rendering the UI.
