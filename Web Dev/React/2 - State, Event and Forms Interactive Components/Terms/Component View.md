### ðŸ”¹ Component View (Short Summary)

In React, a **component view** refers to the **UI part of a component** â€” what it **renders on the screen**. It's defined by the **JSX returned** from the component function.

> ðŸ§  Think of it as **what the user sees**, based on the componentâ€™s state and props.

For example:

```jsx
function Greeting({ name }) {
  return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>; // ðŸ‘ˆ this is the component's "view"
}
```
