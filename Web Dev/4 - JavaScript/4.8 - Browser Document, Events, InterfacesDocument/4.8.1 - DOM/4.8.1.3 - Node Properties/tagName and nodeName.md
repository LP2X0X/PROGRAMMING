Given a DOM node, we can read its tag name from `nodeName` or `tagName` properties.

The difference is reflected in their names, but is indeed a bit subtle.

- The `tagName` property exists only for `Element` nodes.
- The `nodeName` is defined for any `Node`:
    - for elements it means the same as `tagName`.
    - for other node types (text, comment, etc.) it has a string with the node type.

In other words, `tagName` is only supported by element nodes (as it originates from `Element` class), while `nodeName` can say something about other node types.

For instance, letâ€™s compare `tagName` and `nodeName` for the `document` and a comment node:

```html
<body><!-- comment -->

  <script>
    // for comment
    alert( document.body.firstChild.tagName ); // undefined (not an element)
    alert( document.body.firstChild.nodeName ); // #comment

    // for document
    alert( document.tagName ); // undefined (not an element)
    alert( document.nodeName ); // #document
  </script>
</body>
```
