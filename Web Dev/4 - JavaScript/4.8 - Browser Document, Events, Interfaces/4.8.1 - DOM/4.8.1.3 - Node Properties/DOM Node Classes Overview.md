- Different DOM nodes may have different properties.
- Each DOM node belongs to the corresponding built-in class.
</br>
- The root of the hierarchy is [EventTarget](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#eventtarget), that is inherited by [Node](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#interface-node), and other DOM nodes inherit from it.

- Here’s the picture, explanations to follow:

The classes are:

- [EventTarget](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#eventtarget) – is the root “abstract” class for everything.
    
    Objects of that class are never created. It serves as a base, so that all DOM nodes support so-called “events”.
    
- [Node](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#interface-node) – is also an “abstract” class, serving as a base for DOM nodes.
    
    It provides the core tree functionality: `parentNode`, `nextSibling`, `childNodes` and so on (they are getters). Objects of `Node` class are never created. But there are other classes that inherit from it (and so inherit the `Node` functionality).
    
- [Document](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#interface-document), for historical reasons often inherited by `HTMLDocument` (though the latest spec doesn’t dictate it) – is a document as a whole.
    
    The `document` global object belongs exactly to this class. It serves as an entry point to the DOM.
    
- [CharacterData](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#interface-characterdata) – an “abstract” class, inherited by:
    
    - [Text](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#interface-text) – the class corresponding to a text inside elements, e.g. `Hello` in `<p>Hello</p>`.
    - [Comment](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#interface-comment) – the class for comments. They are not shown, but each comment becomes a member of DOM.
- [Element](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#interface-element) – is the base class for DOM elements.
    
    It provides element-level navigation like `nextElementSibling`, `children` and searching methods like `getElementsByTagName`, `querySelector`.
    
    A browser supports not only HTML, but also XML and SVG. So the `Element` class serves as a base for more specific classes: `SVGElement`, `XMLElement` (we don’t need them here) and `HTMLElement`.
    
- Finally, [HTMLElement](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/dom.html#htmlelement) is the basic class for all HTML elements. We’ll work with it most of the time.
    
    It is inherited by concrete HTML elements:
    
    - [HTMLInputElement](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/forms.html#htmlinputelement) – the class for `<input>` elements,
    - [HTMLBodyElement](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/semantics.html#htmlbodyelement) – the class for `<body>` elements,
    - [HTMLAnchorElement](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/semantics.html#htmlanchorelement) – the class for `<a>` elements,
    - …and so on.

There are many other tags with their own classes that may have specific properties and methods, while some elements, such as `<span>`, `<section>`, `<article>` do not have any specific properties, so they are instances of `HTMLElement` class.

So, the full set of properties and methods of a given node comes as the result of the chain of inheritance.

```ad-example
Let’s consider the DOM object for an `<input>` element. It belongs to [HTMLInputElement](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/forms.html#htmlinputelement) class.

It gets properties and methods as a superposition of (listed in inheritance order):

- `HTMLInputElement` – this class provides input-specific properties,
- `HTMLElement` – it provides common HTML element methods (and getters/setters),
- `Element` – provides generic element methods,
- `Node` – provides common DOM node properties,
- `EventTarget` – gives the support for events (to be covered),
- …and finally it inherits from `Object`, so “plain object” methods like `hasOwnProperty` are also available.
  
As we can see, DOM nodes are regular JavaScript objects. They use prototype-based classes for inheritance.
