- In JavaScript, functions are objects. 
- A good way to imagine functions is as callable ‚Äúaction objects‚Äù. We can not only call them, but also treat them as objects: add/remove properties, pass by reference etc.

---

### The ‚Äúname‚Äù property

- Function objects contain some useable properties.
- For instance, a function‚Äôs name is accessible as the ‚Äúname‚Äù property:
	```js
	function sayHi() {
	  alert("Hi");
	}
	
	alert(sayHi.name); // sayHi
	```

- What‚Äôs kind of funny, the name-assigning logic is smart. It also assigns the correct name to a function even if it‚Äôs created without one, and then immediately assigned. In the specification, this feature is called a ‚Äúcontextual name‚Äù. If the function does not provide one, then in an assignment it is figured out from the context.
	```js
	let sayHi = function() {
	  alert("Hi");
	};
	
	alert(sayHi.name); // sayHi (there's a name!)
	```

- It also works if the assignment is done via a default value:
	```js
	function f(sayHi = function() {}) {
	  alert(sayHi.name); // sayHi (works!)
	}
	
	f();
	```

- Object methods have names too:
	```js
	let user = {
	
	  sayHi() {
	    // ...
	  },
	
	  sayBye: function() {
	    // ...
	  }
	
	}
	
	alert(user.sayHi.name); // sayHi
	alert(user.sayBye.name); // sayBye
	```

- There‚Äôs no magic though. There are cases when there‚Äôs no way to figure out the right name. In that case, the name property is empty, like here:
	```js
	// function created inside array
	let arr = [function() {}];
	
	alert( arr[0].name ); // <empty string>
	// the engine has no way to set up the right name, so there is none
	```


---

### The ‚Äúlength‚Äù property

- There is another built-in property ‚Äúlength‚Äù that returns the number of function parameters, for instance:
	```js
	function f1(a) {}
	function f2(a, b) {}
	function many(a, b, ...more) {}
	
	alert(f1.length); // 1
	alert(f2.length); // 2
	alert(many.length); // 2
	```

- Here we can see that rest parameters are not counted.

</br>

- The `length` property is sometimes used for [introspection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_introspection) in functions that operate on other functions.
- For instance, in the code below the `ask` function accepts a `question` to ask and an arbitrary number of `handler` functions to call.
- Once a user provides their answer, the function calls the handlers. We can pass two kinds of handlers:
	- A zero-argument function, which is only called when the user gives a positive answer.
	- A function with arguments, which is called in either case and returns an answer.

- To call `handler` the right way, we examine the `handler.length` property.
- The idea is that we have a simple, no-arguments handler syntax for positive cases (most frequent variant), but are able to support universal handlers as well:
```js
function ask(question, ...handlers) {
  let isYes = confirm(question);

  for(let handler of handlers) {
    if (handler.length == 0) {
      if (isYes) handler();
    } else {
      handler(isYes);
    }
  }

}

// for positive answer, both handlers are called
// for negative answer, only the second one
ask("Question?", () => alert('You said yes'), result => alert(result));
```

- This is a particular case of so-called [polymorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_\(computer_science\)) ‚Äì treating arguments differently depending on their type or, in our case depending on the `length`. The idea does have a use in JavaScript libraries.

### Custom properties

- We can also add properties of our own.
- Here we add the `counter` property to track the total calls count:
	```js
	function sayHi() {
	  alert("Hi");
	
	  // let's count how many times we run
	  sayHi.counter++;
	}
	sayHi.counter = 0; // initial value
	
	sayHi(); // Hi
	sayHi(); // Hi
	
	alert( `Called ${sayHi.counter} times` ); // Called 2 times
	```

```ad-note
A property is not a variable:
- A property assigned to a function like `sayHi.counter = 0` does _not_ define a local variable `counter` inside it. In other words, a property `counter` and a variable `let counter` are two unrelated things.
- We can treat a function as an object, store properties in it, but that has no effect on its execution. Variables are not function properties and vice versa. These are just parallel worlds.
```
- Function properties can replace closures sometimes. For instance, we can rewrite the counter function example from [[Nested functions#üîê Closures Returning Nested Functions|here]] to use a function property:
	```js
	function makeCounter() {
	  // instead of:
	  // let count = 0
	
	  function counter() {
	    return counter.count++;
	  };
	
	  counter.count = 0;
	
	  return counter;
	}
	
	let counter = makeCounter();
	alert( counter() ); // 0
	alert( counter() ); // 1
	```

- The `count` is now stored in the function directly, not in its outer Lexical Environment.
- Is it better or worse than using a closure?
- The main difference is that if the value of `count` lives in an outer variable, then external code is unable to access it. Only nested functions may modify it. And if it‚Äôs bound to a function, then such a thing is possible:
	```js
	function makeCounter() {
	
	  function counter() {
	    return counter.count++;
	  };
	
	  counter.count = 0;
	
	  return counter;
	}
	
	let counter = makeCounter();
	
	counter.count = 10;
	alert( counter() ); // 10
	```

- So the choice of implementation depends on our aims.
