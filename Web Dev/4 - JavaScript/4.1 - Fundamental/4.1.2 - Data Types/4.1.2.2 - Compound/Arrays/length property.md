The `length` property of an **array** in JavaScript represents the number of elements in the array.

### ‚úÖ **How the `length` Property Works**

1. It automatically updates as you add or remove elements.
2. It is a **read/write** property‚Äîyou can change it to manipulate the array.

### üìä **Basic Usage**

```javascript
const fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'];
console.log(fruits.length); // 3
```

### üõ†Ô∏è **Modifying the `length` Property**

1. **Truncate an Array** ‚Äì Reduce the size by setting a smaller length.

```javascript
const nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
nums.length = 3;
console.log(nums); // [1, 2, 3]
```

2. **Expand an Array** ‚Äì Increase the size by setting a larger length (new slots will be `undefined`).

```javascript
const colors = ['red', 'green'];
colors.length = 5;
console.log(colors); // ['red', 'green', undefined, undefined, undefined]
```

### üìà **Edge Cases to Know**

1. **Empty Array** ‚Äì Length is `0`.

```javascript
const empty = [];
console.log(empty.length); // 0
```

2. **Sparse Arrays** ‚Äì Missing indices are still counted.

```javascript
const arr = [];
arr[5] = 'hello';
console.log(arr.length); // 6 (even though only one element exists)
```

### Normalization of the length property

- The `length` property is [converted to an integer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number#integer_conversion) and then clamped to the range between 0 and 253 - 1. `NaN` becomes `0`, so even when `length` is not present or is `undefined`, it behaves as if it has value `0`.

- The language avoids setting `length` to an [unsafe integer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/MAX_SAFE_INTEGER). All built-in methods will throw a [`TypeError`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/TypeError) if `length` will be set to a number greater than 253 - 1. However, because the [`length`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/length) property of arrays throws an error if it's set to greater than 232 - 1, the safe integer threshold is usually not reached unless the method is called on a non-array object.

```js
Array.prototype.flat.call({}); // []
```

- Some array methods set the `length` property of the array object. They always set the value after normalization, so `length` always ends as an integer.

```js
const a = { length: 0.7 };
Array.prototype.push.call(a);
console.log(a.length); // 0
```

### üìå **Key Points to Remember**

- **Dynamic Property** ‚Äì Automatically updates when elements are added or removed.
- **Writable** ‚Äì You can manually change `length` to resize the array.
- **Zero-Indexed** ‚Äì The largest index is always `length - 1`.
