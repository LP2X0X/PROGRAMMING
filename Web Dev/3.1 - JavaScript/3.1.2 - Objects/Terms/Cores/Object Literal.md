- An object literal consists of a pair of braces ({ and }) enclosing a series of key-value pairs, separated by commas.
- Each key-value pair must have a colon between the key and the value.

```js
// This is an object literal
{
  "title": "Casablanca",
  "released": 1942,
  "director": "Michael Curtiz"
}
```
