- The JavaScript `Date` object is used to create, manipulate, and format dates and times. You can create a date using `new Date()`, retrieve components like year, month, and day using `getFullYear()`, `getMonth()`, etc., and modify them with `set` methods. Dates can be compared using operators or timestamps (`getTime()`), and formatted using methods like `toDateString()` or `toLocaleString()`.
