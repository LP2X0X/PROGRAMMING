- Functions form a [scope](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Scope) for variables—this means variables defined inside a function cannot be accessed from anywhere outside the function. The function scope inherits from all the upper scopes. For example, a function defined in the global scope can access all variables defined in the global scope. A function defined inside another function can also access all variables defined in its parent function, and any other variables to which the parent function has access. On the other hand, the parent function (and any other parent scope) does _not_ have access to the variables and functions defined inside the inner function. This provides a sort of encapsulation for the variables in the inner function.

```js
// The following variables are defined in the global scope
const num1 = 20;
const num2 = 3;
const name = "Chamakh";

// This function is defined in the global scope
function multiply() {
  return num1 * num2;
}

console.log(multiply()); // 60

// A nested function example
function getScore() {
  const num1 = 2;
  const num2 = 3;

  function add() {
    return `${name} scored ${num1 + num2}`;
  }

  return add();
}

console.log(getScore()); // "Chamakh scored 5"
```

</br>

- In the code below, we use the [[Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE)]] pattern. Within this IIFE scope, two values exist: a variable `apiCode` and an unnamed function that gets returned and gets assigned to the variable `getCode`. `apiCode` is in the scope of the returned unnamed function but not in the scope of any other part of the program, so there is no way for reading the value of `apiCode` apart from via the `getCode` function.
```js
const getCode = (function () {
  const apiCode = "0]Eal(eh&2"; // A code we do not want outsiders to be able to modify…

  return function () {
    return apiCode;
  };
})();

console.log(getCode()); // "0]Eal(eh&2"
```
