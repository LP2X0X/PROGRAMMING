- Today, JavaScript can execute not only in the browser, but also on the server, or actually on any device that has a special program called [the JavaScript engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript_engine).
- The browser has an embedded engine sometimes called a “JavaScript virtual machine”.
- Different engines have different “codenames”. For example:
	- [V8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V8_\(JavaScript_engine\)) – in Chrome, Opera and Edge.
	- [SpiderMonkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpiderMonkey) – in Firefox.
	- …There are other codenames like “Chakra” for IE, “JavaScriptCore”, “Nitro” and “SquirrelFish” for Safari, etc.
