-  **alert** shows a message and waits for the user to press “OK”. For example:
	```js
	alert("Hello");
	```

- The mini-window with the message is called a _modal window_. The word “modal” means that the visitor can’t interact with the rest of the page, press other buttons, etc, until they have dealt with the window. In this case – until they press “OK”.
