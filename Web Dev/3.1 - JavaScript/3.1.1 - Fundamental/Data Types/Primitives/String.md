- A string in JavaScript must be surrounded by quotes.

```javascript
let str = "Hello";
let str2 = 'Single quotes are ok too';
let phrase = `can embed another ${str}`;
```

- In JavaScript, there are 3 types of quotes.
	1. Double quotes: `"Hello"`.
	2. Single quotes: `'Hello'`.
	3. Backticks: `` `Hello` ``. This is also called a [[Template Literal|template literal]].
