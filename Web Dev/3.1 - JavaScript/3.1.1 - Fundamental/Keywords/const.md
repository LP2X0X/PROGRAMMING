- The **`const`** declaration declares block-scoped local variables. The value of a constant can't be changed through reassignment using the [assignment operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Assignment), but if a constant is an [object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Data_structures#objects), its properties can be added, updated, or removed.
- The value of a const variable can be determine at runtime or before execution. Which mean that a const variable can only be initialize and not reassign.

```ad-note 
Capital-named constants are only used as aliases for “hard-coded” values.
