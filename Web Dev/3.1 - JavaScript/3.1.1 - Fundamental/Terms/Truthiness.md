- **Truthiness** is a special type of coercion that defines how non-Boolean values are treated as [[Boolean|Booleans]]. This allows logical operators like && and ! to be used on any type of value.
	- The **falsy** values include **undefined, null, the number 0, and an empty string ("")**.
	- All **nonzero numbers** and **nonempty strings** are truthy.
