- `Array` objects cannot use arbitrary strings as element indexes (as in an [associative array](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_array)) but must use nonnegative integers (or their respective string form). Setting or accessing via non-integers will not set or retrieve an element from the array list itself, but will set or access a variable associated with that array's [object property collection](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#properties). The array's object properties and list of array elements are separate, and the array's [traversal and mutation operations](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Indexed_collections#array_methods) cannot be applied to these named properties.
- JavaScript syntax requires properties beginning with a digit to be accessed using [bracket notation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Working_with_objects#objects_and_properties) instead of [dot notation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Property_accessors). It's also possible to quote the array indices (e.g., `years['2']` instead of `years[2]`), although usually not necessary.
- The `2` in `years[2]` is coerced into a string by the JavaScript engine through an implicit `toString` conversion. As a result, `'2'` and `'02'` would refer to two different slots on the `years` object, and the following example could be `true`:

```js
console.log(years["2"] !== years["02"]);
```

- Only `years['2']` is an actual array index. `years['02']` is an arbitrary string property that will not be visited in array iteration.
