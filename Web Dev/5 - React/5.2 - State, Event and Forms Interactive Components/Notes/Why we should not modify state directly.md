### 🔹 1. React won’t detect direct changes

React’s rendering system relies on **state setters** (like `setState` or `useState`’s updater) to know something changed.  
If you modify state directly:

```js
state.count = state.count + 1; // ❌ bad
```

React doesn’t know the value changed → **no re-render happens**, so your UI won’t update.

---

### 🔹 2. State updates should be immutable

React encourages **immutability**: instead of changing existing objects/arrays, you create new ones.  
Why?

- Makes changes predictable.
    
- Prevents bugs when multiple components share or depend on the same data.
    
- Plays well with features like **memoization** and **time-travel debugging**.
    

Example (correct way):

```js
setState(prev => ({ ...prev, count: prev.count + 1 })); // ✅
```

### 🔹 3. Breaking React’s batching & optimization

React batches state updates for performance. If you mutate state directly, React’s internal “diffing” (reconciliation) can’t optimize correctly.  
That leads to:

- Missed renders.
    
- Stale or inconsistent UI.
    
- Hard-to-track bugs.

### 🔹 4. Debugging & predictability

With immutable updates:

- You can track how state evolves step by step.
    
- Tools like Redux DevTools or React DevTools can show exact diffs.  
    Direct mutation breaks this chain, making debugging painful.
    

---

### 🔹 5. Concurrency & future features

React’s new features (like **Concurrent Mode** and **useTransition**) rely on the assumption that state is immutable and updated through official setters.  
Mutating state directly could break in subtle, hard-to-debug ways when React runs multiple renders in parallel.

---

✅ **In short:**  
You shouldn’t modify state directly because React won’t notice, the UI won’t update correctly, and you risk breaking React’s optimizations and debugging tools. Always use the provided setters and immutability patterns.
