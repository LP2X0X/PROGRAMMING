# ⭐ Installation & Setup (Redux Toolkit + React-Redux)

Redux Toolkit works **together** with React-Redux. You must install **both**:

### ✅ 1. Install dependencies

Run this in your React project:

```bash
npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux
```

Or with yarn:

```bash
yarn add @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux
```

That’s all — no extra packages like redux-thunk (already included) and no need for redux-devtools-extension (RTK configures DevTools for you).

---

### ✅ 2. Create your store

Create a folder:

```
src/app/store.js
```

Inside:

```js
import { configureStore } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
import counterReducer from "../features/counter/counterSlice";

export const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {
    counter: counterReducer,
  },
});
```

---

### ✅ 3. Provide the store to React

Wrap your `<App />` with `<Provider>`:

```jsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import { Provider } from "react-redux";
import { store } from "./app/store";
import App from "./App";

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root")).render(
  <Provider store={store}>
    <App />
  </Provider>
);
```

---

### ✅ 4. Create a slice

Example: `src/features/counter/counterSlice.js`

```js
import { createSlice } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";

const counterSlice = createSlice({
  name: "counter",
  initialState: { value: 0 },
  reducers: {
    increment(state) {
      state.value++;
    },
    addBy(state, action) {
      state.value += action.payload;
    },
  },
});

export const { increment, addBy } = counterSlice.actions;
export default counterSlice.reducer;
```

### Why do we export these?

---

1️⃣ `counterSlice.actions`

- `counterSlice.actions` is an **object containing action creators** automatically generated by RTK from your `reducers` keys.
    
- `increment` and `addBy` are **functions that return action objects**:
    

- **We export them** so that **other parts of the app (components, thunks, etc.) can dispatch these actions**.
    

**Example usage in a component:**

```js
import { useDispatch } from 'react-redux';
import { increment, addBy } from './counterSlice';

const dispatch = useDispatch();
dispatch(increment());
dispatch(addBy(5));
```

- Without exporting the action creators, components **would not know how to dispatch actions**.
    

2️⃣ `counterSlice.reducer`

```js
export default counterSlice.reducer;
```

- `counterSlice.reducer` is the **reducer function** that handles actions defined in this slice.
    
- **We export it** so it can be added to the Redux store:
    

```js
import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';
import counterReducer from './counterSlice';

const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {
    counter: counterReducer
  }
});
```

- Without exporting the reducer, we **cannot connect this slice to the store**.
    

---

So in short:

- **Actions = for dispatching**
    
- **Reducer = for updating state in store**
    

Both are essential for the slice to be **usable across the app**.

### ✅ 5. Use Redux in a React component

```jsx
import { useSelector, useDispatch } from "react-redux";
import { increment } from "./features/counter/counterSlice";

function Counter() {
  const value = useSelector((state) => state.counter.value);
  const dispatch = useDispatch();

  return (
    <button onClick={() => dispatch(increment())}>
      {value}
    </button>
  );
}

export default Counter;
```
