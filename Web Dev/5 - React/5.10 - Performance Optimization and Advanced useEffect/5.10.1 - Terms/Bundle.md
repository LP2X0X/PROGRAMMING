- A **bundle** in a Single Page Application (SPA) is the **combined, optimized file (or files)** that contain all your app’s JavaScript, CSS, and other assets, created by a bundler like Webpack or Vite for the browser to load.
- Most React apps will have their files “bundled” using tools like [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) or [Browserify](http://browserify.org/).
