## 🧩 What `<Routes>` actually does

In **React Router v6+**, the `<Routes>` component is a **container** that decides **which `<Route>` should render** based on the current URL.

Think of it like a **smart switch**:

```jsx
<Routes>
  <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
  <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
</Routes>
```

When the URL is `/about`, React Router looks at everything inside `<Routes>` and says:

> “Okay, I found a matching route: `/about`.  
> Let’s render its element: `<About />`.”

Only **one matching `<Route>`** (or a nested chain of matches) gets rendered.

## ⚙️ Why not just `<Route>` by itself?

In React Router v5, you could write:

```jsx
<Route path="/" component={Home} />
<Route path="/about" component={About} />
```

And it worked — but that API was **imperative and less predictable**.  
Version 6 made routing **more declarative** and **tree-based**, so:

- `<Routes>` tells React Router:
    
    > “Here’s a list of possible routes. Pick the one that matches.”
    
- `<Route>` just defines **a single path and its element**.
    
- The two **work together**: `<Routes>` is the context manager, `<Route>` is the configuration.
    

---

## 🧠 Analogy

Imagine `<Routes>` as a **map**, and each `<Route>` is a **pin** on that map.

Without the map, React Router doesn’t know how to look up which pin (route) belongs to the current path.

## 🧱 In detail

Here’s what happens under the hood:

1. `<BrowserRouter>` provides the **current URL**.
    
2. `<Routes>` reads that URL.
    
3. `<Routes>` compares it with all its child `<Route>` paths.
    
4. The one that matches gets its `element` rendered.
    

```jsx
<BrowserRouter>
  <Routes>
    <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
    <Route path="/profile" element={<Profile />} />
    <Route path="*" element={<NotFound />} />
  </Routes>
</BrowserRouter>
```

If the URL is `/profile`, React Router will render `<Profile />`.

If you didn’t have `<Routes>`, React Router wouldn’t know which route to pick — it would have no context to perform that comparison.

## ✅ Summary

|Component|Role|Needed?|
|---|---|---|
|`<BrowserRouter>`|Provides URL context and history|✅ Always|
|`<Routes>`|Matches the URL to the correct route|✅ Always in v6+|
|`<Route>`|Defines one path → one component|✅ Always (inside `<Routes>`)|

---

### TL;DR

> You need `<Routes>` because it’s the component that **figures out which `<Route>` matches the current URL** and **renders it**.  
> Without `<Routes>`, `<Route>` alone doesn’t know when or how to render.
