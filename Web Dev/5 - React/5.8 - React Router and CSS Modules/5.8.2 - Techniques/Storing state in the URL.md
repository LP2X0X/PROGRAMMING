- The URL is an excellent place to store UI state and an alternative to useState in some situation. Here are the reason:
	1. Easy way to store state in a global place accessible to all component in the app.
	2. Good way to pass data from one page into the next page.
	3. Make it possible to bookmark and share the page with the exact UI state it had at the time.
