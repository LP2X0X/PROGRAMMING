When using an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework, and DTOs (Data Transfer Objects), there is a typical flow of operations. Here's a step-by-step guide to illustrate the flow:

1. **Define Your Database Entities (Model):**
   - Create classes that represent your database entities or tables. These classes will be your domain models, which are often referred to as entities in the context of an ORM.

    ```csharp
    public class Product
    {
        public int ProductId { get; set; }
        public string Name { get; set; }
        public decimal Price { get; set; }
    }
    ```

2. **Create DTOs:**
   - Define Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) that represent the data you want to transfer between layers or components of your application. DTOs are lightweight objects optimized for specific use cases, often used to transfer data between the business logic layer and the presentation layer.

    ```csharp
    public class ProductDTO
    {
        public string Name { get; set; }
        public decimal Price { get; set; }
    }
    ```

3. **Use ORM to Retrieve Entities from the Database:**
   - Use the ORM framework (such as Dapper) to interact with the database and retrieve entities.

    ```csharp
    public List<Product> GetProducts()
    {
        using (var connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
        {
            connection.Open();
            string sql = "SELECT * FROM Products";
            return connection.Query<Product>(sql).ToList();
        }
    }
    ```

4. **Map Entities to DTOs:**
   - Map the retrieved entities to DTOs. This can be done manually, or you can use tools or libraries that facilitate the mapping.

    ```csharp
    public List<ProductDTO> GetProductDTOs()
    {
        List<Product> products = GetProducts();
        return products.Select(p => new ProductDTO { Name = p.Name, Price = p.Price }).ToList();
    }
    ```

5. **Use DTOs in the Business Logic Layer:**
   - Pass the DTOs to the business logic layer of your application for processing. This layer contains the core logic and rules of your application.

    ```csharp
    public class ProductService
    {
        public List<ProductDTO> GetProductDTOs()
        {
            // Business logic, validation, etc.
            List<ProductDTO> productDTOs = // ...

            return productDTOs;
        }
    }
    ```

6. **Return DTOs to Presentation Layer:**
   - Return the DTOs to the presentation layer (e.g., UI, API) where they can be used to display or present data to users.

    ```csharp
    public ActionResult<IEnumerable<ProductDTO>> GetProducts()
    {
        List<ProductDTO> productDTOs = productService.GetProductDTOs();
        return Ok(productDTOs);
    }
    ```

This flow emphasizes the separation of concerns in your application by using DTOs to transfer data between layers. It also leverages the ORM framework to handle database interactions and mapping between database entities and DTOs.

Remember that the actual implementation details might vary based on the specific requirements of your application and the technologies you are using. Additionally, you might also need to consider aspects like validation, error handling, and performance optimization in your implementation.
