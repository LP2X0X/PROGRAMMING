In C#, value types cannot be assigned a `null` value by default. This is because value types directly contain their data, and there is no concept of a "null" state for them in the same way as for reference types.

Here are the key points to understand:

1. **Value Types vs. Reference Types:**
   - In C#, data types are categorized into two main groups: value types and reference types.
   - Value types include fundamental types like integers (`int`, `long`), floating-point numbers (`float`, `double`), and structures (`struct`).
   - Reference types include classes, interfaces, arrays, and delegates.

2. **Nullability in C#:**
   - Nullability is a concept associated with reference types. Reference types can have a special value called `null`, which signifies the absence of an object reference.

3. **Value Types Are Directly Stored:**
   - Value types are directly stored where they are declared. They don't involve a separate memory allocation and reference, as is the case with reference types.
   - Because of this direct storage, there is no separate state to represent "null."

4. **Nullable Value Types:**
   - To allow value types to represent the concept of "null," C# introduced the concept of nullable value types using the `Nullable<T>` or shorthand `T?` syntax. This allows you to assign `null` to value types, but only when they are explicitly wrapped in the nullable type.

Here's an example using a nullable integer (`int?`):

```csharp
int? nullableInt = null; // OK, because int? is a nullable value type
```

In contrast, the following would result in a compilation error:

```csharp
int regularInt = null; // Compilation error: Cannot convert null to 'int' because it is a non-nullable value type
```

In summary, value types themselves are not nullable by default. If you need to represent a nullable state for a value type, you can use the nullable value type feature in C#.
