A memory leak occurs when a program unintentionally retains references to objects that are no longer needed, preventing the garbage collector from reclaiming the associated memory. In simpler terms, memory leaks happen when a program fails to release memory that is no longer in use, leading to a gradual increase in memory consumption over time.

Here are common scenarios that can cause memory leaks:

1. **Unintentional Object Retention:**
   - Failing to release references to objects that are no longer needed, keeping them in memory indefinitely.

2. **Circular References:**
   - Circular references occur when objects reference each other in a loop. If not handled properly, the garbage collector may be unable to collect these objects.

3. **Unclosed Resources:**
   - Not releasing resources like file handles, database connections, or network sockets properly can lead to memory leaks.

4. **Event Handlers:**
   - Registering event handlers without properly unregistering them can lead to objects being kept in memory longer than necessary.

5. **Static References:**
   - Holding references to objects in static variables can prevent them from being garbage collected, as static variables have a longer lifecycle.

6. **Long-Lived Objects:**
   - Objects that are intended to be short-lived but inadvertently become long-lived can contribute to memory leaks.

### Detecting Memory Leaks:

1. **Memory Profilers:**
   - Using memory profiling tools can help identify memory leaks by analyzing memory usage, object allocations, and object retention over time.

2. **Code Review:**
   - Careful code review can help identify potential issues such as unclosed resources, circular references, or improper handling of object lifetimes.

3. **Monitoring Tools:**
   - System monitoring tools can provide insights into an application's overall memory usage and trends.

### Preventing Memory Leaks:

1. **Proper Resource Management:**
   - Release resources explicitly, close connections, and dispose of objects when they are no longer needed.

2. **Careful Event Handling:**
   - Ensure that event handlers are properly unregistered to avoid keeping objects alive longer than necessary.

3. **Using Weak References:**
   - In certain scenarios, using weak references (as in Prism's Event Aggregator) can help prevent long-lived references and potential memory leaks.

4. **Testing and Profiling:**
   - Regularly test and profile applications to identify and address potential memory leaks during development and testing phases.

5. **Monitoring Application Metrics:**
   - Set up monitoring to detect abnormal increases in memory usage that might indicate memory leaks in a production environment.

Preventing and addressing memory leaks is crucial for maintaining the stability and performance of applications, especially long-running or server-based applications. It requires a combination of good coding practices, proper resource management, and the use of tools to detect and diagnose issues.
