## Short answer
- It helps decoupled from its actual visual representation in the view.
## Long answer
- Commands in WPF are a means of encapsulating and abstracting user actions into a separate and reusable component. By using commands, you can decouple the logic associated with a user action (such as a button click) from the visual representation of the control that triggers the action (such as a button). This decoupling provides several benefits:
	- **Separation of Concerns**: Commands help in separating the concerns of the user interface and the application logic. The logic for handling a command is implemented in the ViewModel, allowing the View to focus on its visual representation.
	- **Reusability**: Commands can be reused across different UI elements. For example, a command for saving data can be associated with a button in one part of the UI and a menu item in another. This reuse is possible because the command is not tied directly to a specific visual element.
	- **Testability**: Decoupling commands from the visual representation makes it easier to test the application's logic. You can write unit tests for ViewModel methods that handle command execution without needing to interact with the actual UI elements.
	- **Flexibility in UI Design**: UI designers and developers can work more independently when commands are used. Designers can focus on creating visually appealing user interfaces, and developers can implement the underlying logic without direct dependencies on UI controls.
